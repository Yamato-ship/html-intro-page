        <h1> Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <p> The name is Le, Henry Le. 
         I'm a Computer Science student at CSUDH.
         This page is my first attempt to create my own webpage.
         Enjoy your stay! Because there isn't much to do here lol.

        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> Seeing that you're still here, I guess you took an interest in my page.
         As mentioned before, I'm in Computer Science major, but it is also my last year as a student, woohoo!
         I like to play tennis as well as go on hikes.
         I also like to play games, like a lot of games.
         I can show you what games I played using HTML lists function. Smart eh?
        </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Elden Ring</l>
            <li>Dave the Diver</li>
            <li>League of Legend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And here is an image of the first game. It is a pretty rad game:</p>
